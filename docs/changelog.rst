- New configuration file `cfg.json` with a new *exclude_stations_id_from_climatology* key for removing some stations with changing altitude.

0.5.7
^^^^^^^
Jul 14, 2022

- Remove time duplicates if they exist in the L2 file (e.g: *L2_0-380-61_A20220708.nc*) that were causing conflicts when trying to read multiple files for computing the climatology with `xarray.open_mfdataset`.

0.5.6
^^^^^^^
Jul 13, 2022

- Fix a bug in the PBL detection that was triggering an *IndexError* when no valid point was found in a profile (e.g: *L2_0-20000-003590_A20220701.nc*).
- Improve the previous clouds detection fix, by checking if any valid point was found in the processed profile.

0.5.5
^^^^^^^
Jul 13, 2022

- Fix a bug in the clouds detection that was triggering an *IndexError* when no valid point was found in a profile (e.g: *L2_0-20000-003590_A20220701.nc*).

0.5.4
^^^^^^^
Jul 12, 2022

- Fix a bug in the clouds detection that was triggering an *IndexError* when data present consecutive equal values vertically (e.g: *L2_0-20000-006432_A20220701.nc* where large squares(time, altitude) are filled with *NaN* values).

0.5.3
^^^^^^^
Jun 20, 2022

- Update *pydata-sphinx-theme* minimum required version from 0.7.2 to 0.9.0 for supporting dark mode ðŸŒ˜.

0.5.2
^^^^^^^
Apr 13, 2022

0.5.1
^^^^^^^
Apr 13, 2022

- Add *compat='override'* option update_climatology function for resolving potential merging issues.

0.5.0
^^^^^^^
Apr 12, 2022

- Add *--update-climatology* option in CLI. This option creates seasonal extinction profiles in one climatology json file per station after reading all AP files available.

0.4.2
^^^^^^^
Apr 12, 2022

- Fix *--from* option in CLI.

0.4.1
^^^^^^^
Jan 31, 2022

- Add *alc_parameters.json* file in CLI config directory for overwriting dataflow parameters for different ALC types.
- Add *--no-progress-bar* option in CLI.

0.4.0
^^^^^^^
Jan 27, 2022

- Add test suite using *pytest* and *pytest-cov*.

0.3.5
^^^^^^^
Jan 18, 2022

- Enables reading of original CEDA archive files with variables having dimensions as (altitude, time) instead of (time, altitude).

- Work on documentation.

0.3.3
^^^^^^^
Dec 13, 2021

- Fix *poetry* warning when publishing to *pip*.

.. note::
    After further investigation, the reported issue with the installation of *aprofiles* with *pip* was due to the use of *-e* option:
    
    - `pip install .` works
    - `pip install . -e` fails

Dec 13, 2021

- Use *multiprocessing* instead of *multithread*.

0.3.0
^^^^^^^
Dec 9, 2021

.. note::
    This version has been removed from *pypi*. Use 0.3.1 instead.

- Fix major bug in *forward* inversion method (use of molecular transmission instead of aerosol transmission).
- Use max altitude as reference altitude when using the forward inversion method.
- Add a *simulator* module for computing attenuated backscatter profiles from a given extinction profile model.
- Remove outliers in standard workflow called by the CLI.

0.2.6
^^^^^^^
Dec 8, 2021

- Rename *run* directory to *cli*
- Rename *aprorun.py* to *aprocess.py*
- Add CLI documentation

0.2.2
^^^^^^^
Nov 30, 2021
