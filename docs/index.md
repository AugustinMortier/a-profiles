*A-Profiles* is a python library dedicated to the analysis of
atmospheric profilers measurements.

Using elastic measurements performed by Lidars and/or ceilometers,
*A-Profiles* includes several modules such as clouds detection, tracking
of the planetary boundary layer height or the retrieval of aerosol
properties (extinction, mass concentration) using some a priori.

At present time, *A-Profiles* supports
[E-PROFILE](https://e-profile.eu/#/cm_profile) data reading. This
library is used by [V-Profiles](https://vprofiles.met.no).
